# About me

Welcome to my personal homepage! I am a master's student specializing in computer vision, focused on developing and applying advanced algorithms and technologies that enable computers to understand and interpret visual information. My passion for computer vision drives me to explore how technology can be utilized to solve complex problems in the real world.

## Research Interests

My research interests primarily include the following areas:

- **Image Processing and Analysis**: Investigating how to extract useful information through image processing techniques to enhance image quality and usability.
- **Deep Learning**: Leveraging deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to advance the field of autonomous driving.
- **Object Detection and Tracking**: Developing efficient algorithms capable of real-time object detection and tracking in dynamic environments.
- **Computer Vision and Robotics**: Exploring the application of computer vision technologies in robotic systems to enhance autonomous navigation and environmental understanding.

## Open Source Project

I am involved in an open-source project called [MOCKSQL](https://github.com/fcdml/MOCKSQL), which aims to randomly generate database data for development and testing purposes. I welcome everyone to visit and contribute!

## Collaboration and Contact

I am always open to collaboration opportunities in both academia and industry. If you are interested in my research or have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me via email.

Thank you for visiting my homepage, and I look forward to sharing more insights about computer vision research with you!
