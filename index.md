## About Me

I am currently a Master's student majoring in Big Data Technology and Engineering at Beijing Technology and Business University (BTBU), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Xiaoming Chen. 
My research interests sit at the intersection of Autonomous Driving, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Generative AI. I am particularly enthusiastic about leveraging LLMs/VLMs to generate physically realistic driving scenarios and enhance human-centric autonomous driving systems.

## Research Interests
